Start playing songs as above when you press "spacebar". Make sure you can still
enter songs properly in the form (the songs shouldn't start playing if you enter
a space while writing the song's notes).


Played songs should be moved to a Played list. Songs from the played list
should:

Add a Repeat button that when toggled will cause the queue to repeat its songs
instead of deleting them (or, moving them to the Played list).
When songs are playing Play All should turn into a Pause button, clicking it
will pause the queue and turn it into a Play All button again.
